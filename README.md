<h1>Installing Active Directory </h1>
In this lab, I explored and analyzed network traffic to and from Azure virtual machines using Wireshark and experimented with network security groups to better understand their impact on traffic control.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop Connection
- Command-Line Tools
- Network Protocols: SSH, RDP, DNS, HTTP/S, ICMP
- Wireshark (Protocol Analyzer)

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>
- Windows 10</b> (21H2)
- Ubuntu Server 22.04

<h2>List of Prerequisites</h2>

- Azure Virtual Machine
- osTicket Installation Files

<h2>Lab Set-Up</h2>
<p>I created two virtual machines within Azure on the same virtual network to enable internal communication. One VM was configured with Windows 10 Pro and the other with Ubuntu Server 20.04.</p>

<h2>Actions and Observations</h2>

<p>
Using Remote Desktop Connection, I connected to the Windows VM using its public IP address and installed Wireshark to begin traffic inspection.
