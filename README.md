</p>
<p>
First, we will set up a Resource Group (RG) in the Microsoft Azure Cloud Service. A resource group can be considered a folder that holds resources. We will name this resource group "osTickets" and set its location to US East. It is best practice to select the location closest to you. Please take note of the region where the RG is created, as it will be used in future instances.
